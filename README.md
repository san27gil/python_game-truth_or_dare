# Truth or dare game. :innocent: :beers:
Basic game where you can show either questions or challenges one by one. <br><br>
I use the Python library of Beutifulsoup to scrape the web and grab all questions, in this case from spanish websites. <br><br>
You can replace the two links I use with websites of your own. <br><br>
If you do so, make sure to adjust the number of questions for each list because I grabbed 135 questions and 35 challenges. It'll depends of your links. <br><br>
Enjoy it and have fun! :wink: <br><br>
